Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a powerful layout mode in CSS that allows you to design complex layouts more efficiently. With Flexbox, you can easily align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
Basic Concepts
Flex Container: The parent element that holds flex items.
Flex Items: The child elements within the flex container.
Main Axis: The primary axis along which flex items are laid out (default is horizontal).
Cross Axis: The axis perpendicular to the main axis.
